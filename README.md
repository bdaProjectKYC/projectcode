# projectcode

To start the project in local:

In projectcode root folder, run "npm install", then run "npm start". Alternatively, for yarn, use "yarn dev" . This will run hte node code on express server.

Then do "cd client" to go into the client folder and then run "npm install" and "npm install recharts". Next run "npm start" if using npm to start the client on localhost. Alternatively for yarn, use "yarn start".
